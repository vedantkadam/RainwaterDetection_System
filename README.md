# Rainwater Detection System

### Introduction

- Rainwater detection is an essential task in various fields such as agriculture, water conservation, and weather forecasting. In this project, we have used an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect rainwater and send notifications to the user via email and/or SMS. In this readme file, we will provide detailed instructions on how to build the rainwater detection system using ESP8266.

### Hardware Requirements

* ESP8266 Development Board
* Raindrop Sensor
* Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* USB Cable

### Software Requirements

* NodeMCU8266
* ESP8266 Libraries (in Arduino IDE)
* Blynk IOT Account

## Installation
To set up the Rainwater Detection System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vedantkadam/RainwaterDetection_System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install any necessary dependencies specified in the project's documentation.
4. Configure the system by following the instructions provided in the project's documentation.

## Usage
To use the Rainwater Detection System, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure that the system is properly installed and configured.
2. Power on the rainwater sensors and ensure they are connected to the system.
3. Run the system software or execute the main script to start collecting rainwater data.
4. Monitor the system output or user interface for real-time rainfall information and analytics.
5. Analyze the collected data to gain insights into rainfall patterns and make informed decisions regarding water management.
