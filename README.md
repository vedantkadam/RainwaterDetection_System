# Rainwater Detection System

### Introduction

- Rainwater detection is an essential task in various fields such as agriculture, water conservation, and weather forecasting. In this project, we have used an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect rainwater and send notifications to the user via email and/or SMS. In this readme file, we will provide detailed instructions on how to build the rainwater detection system using ESP8266.

### Hardware Requirements
